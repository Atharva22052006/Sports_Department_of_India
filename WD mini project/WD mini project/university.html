        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        Nelson Mandela, the Nobel laureate for peace and former president of
        South Africa, said in one of his speeches, “Sport has the power to
        change the world. It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite
        people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language
        they understand. Sport can create hope where once there was only
        despair…” But to inspire the next generation, we need the right
        professionals to lead and coach them in sports. It is with this as one
        of the missions that the National Sports University, Manipur, was set up
        in 2018. The University is presently functional from its temporary
        campus at the Khuman Lampak Sports Complex of Imphal. Prime Minister of
        India, Shri Narendra Modi, laid the foundation stone for the
        University’s proposed 325 acre campus at Imphal West, on 16th March
        2018. Dr. Najima Heptulla, Governor of Manipur, Col. Rajyavardhan
        Rathore (Retd.), AVSM, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Youth
        Affairs & Sports, were also present on the occasion. The National Sports
        University will have the flexibility to open new schools/departments in
        consonance with the advances and developments in sports science, sports
        medicine, and allied areas. The University, once developed, will be the
        first one of its kind to promote sports education in the areas of sports
        sciences, sports technology, sports management, and sports coaching. It
        will also function as the national training centre for selected sports
        disciplines by adopting the best international practices by signing
        Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with international universities. The
        Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has already signed MoUs with the
        Universities of Canberra and Victoria in April 2017.
